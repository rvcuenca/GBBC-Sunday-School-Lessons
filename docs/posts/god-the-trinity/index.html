<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the last lesson, we have listed down the so-called “laws” that serve as tools for our analysis in resolving the common issues regarding the deity of Christ. We now present the basic assumption or core beliefs that we accept by faith based on the Scriptures upon which we anchor our succeeding logical responses on addressing the said issues. The first of which pertains to God’s very existence based on both the facts about Creation and facts based on Scriptures.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-belief-in-the-existence-of-god">The Belief in the Existence of God</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The belief that a divine being exists who is greater than man has been common to all cultures | and civilizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Man seems intuitively, by his very religious nature, to reach out to some sort of higher being.</p></li>
<li><p>This has been due in part to the fact that man reasons there must be an explanation for our world and for human existence, and that a being greater than man would serve to explain this.</p></li>
<li><p>Ordinarily, men do not ask for proofs of their own existence nor the existence of material things which they recognize by their senses.</p></li>
<li><p>Although God is unseen as to His person, His existence is so evident that men generally require no proofs for the fact that there is a God.</p></li>
<li><p>The evidence for the existence of God in creation is so clear that rejection of it is the ground of condemnation of the heathen world regardless of whether or not they have heard the Gospel message. The Bible reveals that doubt of God’s existence is primarily due to man’s own perversity and blindness and to satanic influence.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Romans 1:18-20 “ <sup>18</sup>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; <sup>19</sup>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. <sup>20</sup>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Although ancient Greek philosophers were unfamiliar with biblical revelation, they attempted to make attempts to explain man’s universe on the basis of a higher being (or higher beings). Various systems of thoughts were presented and evolved into “reasonable” explanations of who this higher being (or these higher beings) could be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Polytheism</strong> – The belief in many gods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hylozoism</strong> – The belief that the life principle found in all creation is God Himself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Materialism</strong> – The belief that matter is self-functioning according to natural law and no god is necessary to its functioning (i.e.&nbsp;a theory supporting modern evolutionism!).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pantheism</strong> – The belief that God is impersonal and identical with nature itself. God is immanent (i.e.&nbsp;“close and involved with all of creation”) but not transcendent (i.e.&nbsp;“separate from and far more advanced than all of creation”).</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Ontological Argument</strong> – Of or relating to the argument for the existence of God holding that man’s universal “belief in God” and the overwhelming existence of the “concept of God” proves the existence of God. It is widely accepted that the first ontological argument was proposed by Anselm of Canterbury. Anselm’s argument goes as follows:</p>

Anselm’s Ontological Argument
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li>God is the greatest possible being we can conceive whose being could exist in the mind.</li>
<li>If the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality.</li>
<li>If it only exists in the mind, a greater being is possible – one which exists in the mind and in reality.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>The Cosmological Argument</strong> – Every effect must have its sufficient cause and, therefore, the universe, which is an effect, must have a Creator as its cause. Logic based on these premises:</p>

<li>Whatever begins to exist has a cause.</li>
<li>The Universe began to exist.</li>
<li>Therefore, the Universe had a cause.</li>
<li>The cause of the universe (i.e.&nbsp;all things created) can be called God.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>The Teleological Argument</strong> – Everything that has been designed must have a designer. Since creation as a whole reveals itself as being intricately designed and interrelated, creation must have a great designer. This designer can be called God.</p>

<li>If you found a watch lying on the ground, you would not assume that the watch “accidentally” came into existence by colliding metal, glass, and wires.</li>
<li>Rather, you would naturally assume there must be a “watchmaker” who designed and made the watch.</li>
<li>In the same way, since the universe has shown itself to be vastly more complicated, more intricately designed, and more dependable than a watch, there must be a “creation maker” who made the universe of infinite power and wisdom.</li>
<li>This “creation maker” can be called God.</li>

<li><p>The many indications in both the Old and New Testaments that God exists as one God that is a “triune being” have made the doctrine of the Trinity a central FACT of all orthodox creeds from the early church until modern times:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Any departure from the teaching that the Bible reveals God as existing as “One God in Three Persons” is considered a departure from scriptural truth (i.e.&nbsp;heretical teaching!).</p></li>
<li><p>Although the word “Trinity” does not occur in the Bible, the facts of scriptural revelation permit no other explanation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>While the doctrine of the Trinity is a central fact of Christian faith, it is also beyond human comprehension and has no parallel in human experience: :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It is best defined as holding that, while God is one God, He exists in three persons.</p></li>
<li><p>These persons are equal, have the same attributes, and are equally worthy of adoration, worship, and faith.</p></li>
<li><p>They are NOT three separate gods, like three separate human beings as Peter, James, and John.</p></li>
<li><p>The persons of the Trinity, while having equal attributes, differ in certain properties:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>The First Person of the Trinity is called God, the Father.</p></li>
<li><p>The Second Person of the Trinity is called God, the Son and is sent forth by the Father.</p></li>
<li><p>The Third Person of the Trinity is called God, the Holy Spirit and is sent forth by the Son.</p>

</div>

</ol></li>
<li><p>The most common name for God in the Old Testament is “Elohim”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning&nbsp;God (<strong>i.e.&nbsp;“Elohim”</strong>) created the heaven and the earth.”</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ul>
<li><strong>“Elohim”</strong> is used in the Old Testament 2,570 times, and every usage is plural- “gods”.</li>
<li>As shown by this plurality, the God Family clearly consists of more than one Person or Personality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The meaning of the name has been debated, but seems to include the idea of being the “strong one” and being one to be feared or reverenced.</p></li>
<li><p>Because it is in a plural form, it seems to include all the Trinity.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Genesis 1:26 “And God (<strong>i.e.&nbsp;“Elohim” - plural</strong>) said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The third name for God in the Old Testament is “Adonai”:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Commonly means “master” or “lord” and is used not only of God as our Master, but also of men who are masters over their servants.</p></li>
<li><p>When God is written as “LORD” in the Bible, this means the name “Yahweh” is being translated into English; but, when God is written as “Lord” in the Bible, this means “Adonai” is being translated into English.</p></li>
<li><p>“Adonai” is frequently joined to “Elohim” in the Bible and when so used it emphasizes the fact that God is our Master or Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Genesis 15:2 “And Abram said, Lord GOD (<strong>i.e.&nbsp;Adonai Elohim</strong>), what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?”</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>To the combinations of the three primary names of God are many other compounds found in the Old Testament such as:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Genesis 22:14 “And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Judges 6:23-24 <sup>23</sup>And the LORD said unto him, Peace <em>be</em> unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. <sup>24</sup>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it <em>is</em> yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>“Jehovah-tsidkenu” (meaning “the Lord our righteousness”):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jeremiah 23:5-6 <sup>5</sup>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. <sup>6</sup>In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <em>is</em> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (i.e.&nbsp;“Jehovah-tsidkenu”’). ”</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>In the New Testament, additional titles of God are found:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The First Person of the Trinity as being distinguished as “the Father”, the Second Person distinguished as “the Son”, and the Third Person distinguished as “the Holy Spirit”. These titles, of course, are also found in the Old Testament but are more common in the New Testament.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>The attributes of God make clear that God is supreme over all. He yields to no other power, authority or glory, and is not subject to any absolute greater than Himself.</p></li>
<li><p>He represents perfection to an infinite degree in every aspect of His being. He can NEVER be surprised, defeated, or uncertain.</p></li>
<li><p>However, without sacrificing His authority or jeopardizing the final realization of His perfect will, it has pleased God to give men a “measure” of freedom of choice, and for the exercise of this choice, God holds man responsible.</p></li>
<li><p>Because man in his depraved state is blind and insensitive to the work of God, it is clear from Scripture that men do not turn to God apart from the moving of His Spirit in their hearts: John 6:44 “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

<p>Philippians 2:13 “. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;good pleasure.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Yet, God does not force men to yield themselves to Him but rather beseeches them to do so:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Romans 12:1 “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,&nbsp;<em>which is</em>&nbsp;your reasonable service.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The fact that God has given to men certain freedom does not introduce an element of uncertainty into the universe, as God anticipates in advance and knows to infinity all that man will do in response to the divine and human influences which come into his life.</p></li>
<li><p>His sovereignty therefore infinitely extends to every act even if it be to the temporary permission of evil that ultimately God might be glorified.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="v.-the-degree-of-god">V. The Degree of God:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The sovereign purpose of God is defined theologically as the “decree of God”, referring to the comprehensive plan that includes all events of every classification which will occur.The decree of God includes those events which God does Himself and also includes all that God accomplishes through natural law, over which He is completely sovereign.</li>
<li>More difficult to comprehend is the fact that His sovereign decree also extends to all the acts of men, which are included in His eternal plan. While incomprehensible to us, it is evident that the all-wise God, having complete knowledge of what man would do in his freedom, in electing to give man freedom of choice does not introduce any element of uncertainty.
<ol type="a">
<li><p>This means, the divine plan, accordingly, included permitting man to sin as Adam and Eve did with all the resultant acts of sin.</p></li>
<li><p>It included the divine remedy of Christ dying on the cross and all the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing men to repentance and faith in spite of their sin.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Although the working of God in human hearts is inscrutable (i.e.&nbsp;“cannot be learned or understood”), the Bible is plain that on the one hand what man does has been included in God’s eternal decree and on the other hand man operates with freedom of choice and is held responsible for his choices.</li>

<li>The Belief in the Existence of God</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>1.  What is a belief that is common to all cultures and civilizations?
2.  Mans seems intuitively, by his very religious nature, to do what?
3.  Although God is unseen as to His person, His existence is so evident that men generally do NOT require what?
4.  The Bible reveais that “doubt” of God’s existence is primarily due to what? (page 1, middle)
5.  According to Romans 1:18, what do “godless” and “wicked” men do with the “truth” that God reveals to them about Himself?
6.  True or False. If a person is born in a remote village in a third world country and never hears the gospel of Jesus Christ, that person has an “excuse” to not believe in God,
7.  Describe what a person who is a “pantheist” believes about God.</code></pre>
