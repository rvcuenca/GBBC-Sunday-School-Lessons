    "text": "The Tools Para Dili Mailad\n\nThe Law of Non-Verbatim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if it is not mentioned word-for-word, it doesn’t mean that it is not there.\n\n\n\nIf a word or phrase describing a concept is not mentioned verbatim (i.e. word-for-word) in a given reference material, it does not follow that the concept itself is not present in the same material.\nExamples:\n\nThe word “Trinity” can never be found word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of Trinity is explained in the Bible.\nThe word “rapture” is never mentioned word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of rapture is explained in the Bible.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Non-Contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can never say two opposing claims at the same time.\n\n\n\nTwo claims of opposite meaning or implication can never be both true at the same time in the same sense. Another way of looking at this is that two opposing descriptions can never be attributed to the same object at the same time.\nExamples:\n\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nMaria ate the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.\nMaria did not eat the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.\n\nIf, in the two claims above, we are referring to the same Maria, the same black mango, the same location (our table), and at the same reference point in time (yesterday at 1pm), then we have a contradiction here.\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nThe top surface of the table is dirty.\nThe top surface of the table is clean.\n\nIf we are referring here to the same table, then the two claims are contradictory.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Excluded Middle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA claim is either true or false but not both.\n\n\n\nA claim can never be both true and false at the same time, i.e. it is either true or false but it is never both.\nExamples:\n\nJesus is either God or is not God. However, he can never be both.\nEither the Bible has contradictions or it has contradictions. However, it can never be both cases.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Correct Reference Sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we referring to the same things here?\n\n\n\nWhen you try to resolve another person’s claim, be sure that both of you are referring to the same terminologies (in the sense of definition) from the same reference points (object, space, and time).\nExample:\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nPerson A Claim: Maria ate the mango.\nPerson B Claim: Maria did not eat the mango.\n\nThe two claims seems to be contradictory. However, we first need to check the following conditions before proceed with such verdict of contradiction:\n\nAre we referring to the same Maria?\nIf person A is referring to a different Maria compared to that claimed by person B, then it does not make sense in the first place to say that there is a contradiction since the two claims are not comparable.\nAre we referring to the same mango?\nThis is similar to the case of having the same Maria being referred to.\nAre we referring to the same reference point in time when incident happened?\nEven if we refer to the same Maria and the same mango,it might still be invalid to say that the two claims are contradictory if we have different reference point in time where the alleged eating happened. It is possible that the two claims are both true, for example, if person A’s claim indeed happened yesterday while person B’s claim really happened today. In this case, we do not have a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Logical Absurdity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though it does not make sense to you by experience, it does not follow that it is impossible.\n\n\n\nOne must differentiate between personal subjective absurdity and logical absurdity.\n\nPersonal subjective absurdity means that something does not make sense based on one’s personal subjective experience but not necessarily logically false in reality.\nFor example, if a person living his whole in an isolated island with no idea of WIFI nor cellular mobile phones, then it would be absurd (i.e. does not make sense) to that person if you claim that you can talk to somebody on the other side of the world using small rectangular object (a.k.a cellphone via the internet). However, even if it does not make sense to him, it does not follow that it is impossible to do so.\nLogical absurdity simply means that it is not logically possible in the sense of the Law of Non-Contradiction.\nFor example, one can never have a square shape that is circle at the same time. A logically absurd claim is not only logically contradictory but also does not make sense in the personal subjective level.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Accurate Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplicity does not necessarily be the correct answer.\n\n\n\nEveryone of us, at some point in our lives, at least once desired that some things should be done as simple as possible. Humans, by nature, do not want to complicate things. This also applies in attempting to describe or explain things in our surroundings. No parent has ever attempted to explain scientifically to their 1 year old child what walking is. However, when seeking what is true and was not true, simple explanations just do not fit the role of an arbiter or judge.\nConsider the following cases:\n\nPerson A is a simple farmer in a third-world country in Asia without basic education. He does not need to know about advanced Physics in order to answer the question of what would happened next if a fruit of an apple is cut-off from its branch without catching it. He does not need to know what gravity is in order to conclude that the apple would fall to the ground. He simply relies on his daily experience since the day he gained consciousness to interact with the physical reality that objectives when thrown from certain heights would fall downward to the ground.\nPerson B is a high-school student who reads about rockets flying to the outer space. If he wants to learn why rockets no longer fall back to the ground when it reaches a certain height after lunching, he needs to have a more ‘above simple’ explanation than that of Person A. Person A’s personal subjective experience no longer can provide a more accurate explanation of the question Person B wants to be answered. Then, Person B learns about Isaac Newton’s Law of Gravitation where the concept of gravity is now explained: The farther an object is from the surface of the Earth, the weaker the gravitational pull becomes. Nobody has seen gravity. However, Newton’s ‘beyond simple experience’ explanation provides a better, more accurate explanation that the force of gravity exists.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Evidently Plausible Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation that is supported by historical and/or scientific evidence, is the more likely correct interpretation.\n\n\n\nThe Bible, aside from a being the word of God, is a historical account of past events. Throughout the years, several people both theologians and non-theologians (which include non-believers like cults, atheists, and skeptics) have come with several interpretations of some passages of the Bible. Aside from our presuppositional stand that the Bible has no contradictions on the bases of our faith that it is the word of God, we also back-up such faith with evidence both historically and scientifically.\nIf a Biblical passage connects to a scientific or historical claim and has several interpretations, we opt to choose the most interpretation which is more plausible based on the historical and scientific evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHowever, one should be warned of the dangers of taking scientific theory as truths. Not all so-called scientific theories are truths. They are called “theory” for a reason since they are “attempted explanations” of some physical reality under some simplifying assumptions. Consider the Theory of Evolution which was “celebrated” before but now debunked by the modern scientific community. That is the nature of Science: theories continually evolve to newer ones when new scientific evidence is found. A classic example of this is the theory about gravity which evolved from Newton’s Law of Gravitation, to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, and to Hawking’s Quantum Theory. Each of these has increasing complexity of interpretation regarding the concept of gravity in the face of new evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHistorical evidence, then, comes into precedence than theories crafted by Science when used as bases for interpreting Bible passages. Historical evidence includes (but not limited to) interpreting by recounting historical context such cultural background and customary practices of the people and the place mentioned in the passage.\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Consistent Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency is always the best policy.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a collection of claims (or statements) that shown to have consistent interpretations (i.e. without the presence of contradictions). If another statement can be interpreted by two but opposing claims, then we prefer to choose the more claim that is consistent with the existing collection.\nFor example, we have the following COLLECTION of statements:\n\nThe Bible has no contradictions.\nThere are several verses in the Bible that support the claim that salvation is by faith and not by works.\nThe verses James 2:17, 22 are part of the Bible.\nTherefore, the interpretation of James 2:17, 22 should be consistent of the other verses.\n\nNow we have two conflicting claims:\n\nJames 2:17, 22 means works + faith =&gt; salvation (i.e. salvation is by faith AND good works).\nJames 2:17, 22 means faith =&gt; salvation + works. (i.e. faith RESULTS TO salvation and good works).\n\nBy the Law of Consistent Interpretation, we opt to choose the second interpretation (ii) since it is consistent with the collection of statements above. If we choose the first statement (i), then we arrive with a contradiction to #2 (salvation is by faith alone) above which consequently contradicts #1 that the Bible has no contradictions."
