    "text": "Introduction\nIn 2 Peter 3:15,16, Peter acknowledged the writings of apostle Paul:\n\nas “scripture”,\nreaffirms the sureness of Jesus’ second coming,\ncontains portions that are “hard to be understood”\nhad been twisted by false teachers.\n\nThe word “wrest” in 2 Peter 3:16 stands for the Greek word “strebloo” (v. stre-bla-oh) which means to twist, turn awry, or metaphorically, to pervert, of one who tortures language in a false sense1. In other words, even as early as the time of Peter and Paul, there are already false teachers who pervert their written epistles by taking advantage of the possible difficulty understanding their level of writing. That’s why in the next verse, v. 17, Peter warns the believers in his time to “beware lest [they] also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from [their] own stedfastness.”\nPeter closes his second epistle by admonishing the believers he addressed to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” He points out that the ultimate solution to “fight against” false teachings is to grow both in the grace of our Lord, i.e. to be dependent on His grace for our growth, and in knowledge about our Saviour, i.e. getting to know about who Jesus is and to know Him more on a personal level of relationship. Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:11-14 clearly affirms this point of not being deceived by learning more about the Son of God through agents God has provided for us:\n\n 11And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;\n\nEven though Peter and Paul’s epistles were written more than 2000 years ago, the same principle even more applies to us today where false teachers have become more bold and rampant in deceiving many. Such deception have been scaled-up to highher level by taking advantage of modern media technology via fast internet connectivity. Thus, we as believers in this post-modern age should be even more proactive in fervently studying God’s word to guard not only ourselves but our future generations of believers from the ever “upgrading” deception tactics of the enemy."

    "text": "The Tools Para Dili Mailad\nLanguage traps refer to words or phrases whose meaning isn’t clear to readers and, worse, can potentially mislead them into thinking you mean something you don’t (Hurley 2024). False teachers (and their blinded followers) that utilize language traps are either using them intentionally to deceive or even they themselves are not aware that they are using it.\n\n2 Timothy 2:13 – But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. \n\nIt is important for believers to be equipped with the basics of untangling such traps if ever one encounters them. Learning them not helps you clarify the veiled perversion done by deceivers, it will also help strengthen your reading skills on the word of God.\n\nThe Law of Non-Verbatim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if it is not mentioned word-for-word, it doesn’t mean that it is not there.\n\n\n\nIf a word or phrase describing a concept is not mentioned verbatim (i.e. word-for-word) in a given reference material, it does not follow that the concept itself is not present in the same material.\nExamples:\n\nThe word “Trinity” can never be found word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of Trinity is explained in the Bible.\nThe word “rapture” is never mentioned word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of rapture is explained in the Bible.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Overextraploation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not make conclusions beyond what knowledge is available.\n\n\n\nOftentimes the root of almost all misunderstanding between two parties proposing two conflicting claims is “over-assumption”, i.e. one-side or both parties assumed beyond the available evidence or knowledge, and make extravagant conclusions beyond it. Consider the following:\n\nEncountering your teenage young lady neighbor with tummy-size bigger than normal and conclude that she is pregnant.\nA man questioned as suspect of thief but remained silent when asked if he is the one who really committed the crime. You then conclude that he is the thief because he did not deny it.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Non-Contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can never say two opposing claims at the same time.\n\n\n\nTwo claims of opposite meaning or implication can never be both true at the same time in the same sense. Another way of looking at this is that two opposing descriptions can never be attributed to the same object at the same time.\nExamples:\n\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nMaria ate the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.\nMaria did not eat the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.\n\nIf, in the two claims above, we are referring to the same Maria, the same black mango, the same location (our table), and at the same reference point in time (yesterday at 1pm), then we have a contradiction here.\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nThe top surface of the table is dirty.\nThe top surface of the table is clean.\n\nIf we are referring here to the same table, then the two claims are contradictory.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Excluded Middle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA claim is either true or false but not both.\n\n\n\nA claim can never be both true and false at the same time, i.e. it is either true or false but it is never both.\nExamples:\n\nJesus is either God or is not God. However, he can never be both.\nEither the Bible has contradictions or it has no contradictions. However, it can never be both cases.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Correct Reference Sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we referring to the same things here?\n\n\n\nWhen you try to resolve another person’s claim, be sure that both of you are referring to the same terminologies (in the sense of definition) from the same reference points (object, space, and time).\nExample:\nConsider the following two claims:\n\nPerson A Claim: Maria ate the mango.\nPerson B Claim: Maria did not eat the mango.\n\nThe two claims seems to be contradictory. However, we first need to check the following conditions before proceed with such verdict of contradiction:\n\nAre we referring to the same Maria?\nIf person A is referring to a different Maria compared to that claimed by person B, then it does not make sense in the first place to say that there is a contradiction since the two claims are not comparable.\nAre we referring to the same mango?\nThis is similar to the case of having the same Maria being referred to.\nAre we referring to the same reference point in time when incident happened?\nEven if we refer to the same Maria and the same mango,it might still be invalid to say that the two claims are contradictory if we have different reference point in time where the alleged eating happened. It is possible that the two claims are both true, for example, if person A’s claim indeed happened yesterday while person B’s claim really happened today. In this case, we do not have a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Logical Absurdity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though it does not make sense to you by experience, it does not follow that it is impossible.\n\n\n\nOne must differentiate between personal subjective absurdity and logical absurdity.\n\nPersonal subjective absurdity means that something does not make sense based on one’s personal subjective experience but not necessarily logically false in reality.\nFor example, if a person living his whole life in an isolated island with no idea of WIFI nor cellular mobile phones, then it would be absurd (i.e. does not make sense) to that person if you claim that you can talk to somebody on the other side of the world using a small rectangular object (a.k.a cellphone via the internet). However, even if it does not make sense to him, it does not follow that it is impossible to do so.\nLogical absurdity simply means that it is not logically possible in the sense of the Law of Non-Contradiction.\nFor example, one can never have a square shape that is circle at the same time. A logically absurd claim is not only logically contradictory but also does not make sense in the personal subjective level.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Accurate Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplicity is not necessarily the correct answer.\n\n\n\nEveryone of us, at some point in our lives, at least once desired that some things should be done as simple as possible. Humans, by nature, do not want to complicate things. This also applies in attempting to describe or explain things in our surroundings. No parent has ever attempted to explain scientifically to their 1 year old child what walking is. However, when seeking what is true and is not true, simple explanations just do not fit the role of an arbiter or judge.\nConsider the following cases:\n\nPerson A is a simple farmer in a third-world country in Asia without basic education. He does not need to know about advanced Physics in order to answer the question of what would happened next if a fruit of an apple is cut-off from its branch without catching it. He does not need to know what gravity is in order to conclude that the apple would fall to the ground. He simply relies on his daily experience since the day he gained consciousness to interact with the physical reality that objectives when thrown from certain heights would fall downward to the ground.\nPerson B is a high-school student who reads about rockets flying to the outer space. If he wants to learn why rockets no longer fall back to the ground when it reaches a certain height after lunching, he needs to have a more ‘above simple’ explanation than that of Person A. Person A’s personal subjective experience no longer can provide a more accurate explanation of the question Person B wants to be answered. Then, Person B learns about Isaac Newton’s Law of Gravitation where the concept of gravity is now explained: The farther an object is from the surface of the Earth, the weaker the gravitational pull becomes. Nobody has seen gravity. However, Newton’s ‘beyond simple experience’ explanation provides a better, more accurate explanation that the force of gravity exists.\n\n\n\nThe Law of Evidently Plausible Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation that is supported by historical and/or scientific evidence, is the more likely correct interpretation.\n\n\n\nThe Bible, aside from being the word of God, includes a historical account of past events. Throughout the years, several people both theologians and non-theologians (which include non-believers like cults, atheists, and skeptics) have come up with several interpretations of some passages of the Bible. Aside from our presuppositional stand that the Bible has no contradictions on the bases of our faith that it is the word of God, we also back-up such faith with evidence both historically and scientifically.\nIf a Biblical passage connects to a scientific or historical claim and has several interpretations, we opt to choose the interpretation which is more plausible based on the historical and scientific evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHowever, one should be warned of the dangers of taking scientific theory as truths. Not all so-called scientific theories are truths. They are called “theory” for a reason since they are “attempted explanations” of some physical reality under some simplifying assumptions. Consider the Theory of Evolution which was “celebrated” before but now debunked by the modern scientific community. That is the nature of Science: theories continually evolve to newer ones when new scientific evidence is found. A classic example of this is the theory about gravity which evolved from Newton’s Law of Gravitation, to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, and to Hawking’s Quantum Theory. Each of these has increasing complexity of interpretation regarding the concept of gravity in the face of new evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHistorical evidence, then, comes into precedence than theories crafted by Science when used as bases for interpreting Bible passages. Historical evidence includes (but not limited to) interpreting by recounting historical context such as cultural background and customary practices of the people and the place mentioned in the passage.\n\n\n\n\nThe Law of Consistent Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency is always the best policy.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a collection of claims (or statements) that shown to have consistent interpretations (i.e. without the presence of contradictions). If another statement can be interpreted by two but opposing claims, then we prefer to choose the claim that is more consistent with the existing collection.\nFor example, we have the following COLLECTION of statements:\n\nThe Bible has no contradictions.\nThere are several verses in the Bible that support the claim that salvation is by faith and not by works.\nThe verses James 2:17, 22 are part of the Bible.\nTherefore, the interpretation of James 2:17, 22 should be consistent of the other verses.\n\nNow we have two conflicting claims:\n\nJames 2:17, 22 means works + faith =&gt; salvation (i.e. salvation is by faith AND good works).\nEphesians 2:8-10 means faith =&gt; salvation + works. (i.e. faith RESULTS TO salvation and good works).\n\nBy the Law of Consistent Interpretation, we opt to choose the second interpretation (ii) since it is consistent with the collection of statements above. If we choose the first statement (i), then we arrive with a contradiction to #2 (salvation is by faith alone) above which consequently contradicts #1 that the Bible has no contradictions."

    "text": "The Belief in the Existence of God\n\nThe belief that a divine being exists who is greater than man has been common to all cultures | and civilizations.\nMan seems intuitively, by his very religious nature, to reach out to some sort of higher being.\nThis has been due in part to the fact that man reasons there must be an explanation for our world and for human existence, and that a being greater than man would serve to explain this.\nOrdinarily, men do not ask for proofs of their own existence nor the existence of material things which they recognize by their senses.\nAlthough God is unseen as to His person, His existence is so evident that men generally require no proofs for the fact that there is a God.\nThe evidence for the existence of God in creation is so clear that rejection of it is the ground of condemnation of the heathen world regardless of whether or not they have heard the Gospel message. The Bible reveals that doubt of God’s existence is primarily due to man’s own perversity and blindness and to satanic influence.\n\nRomans 1:18-20 “ 18For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 19Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 20For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:”\n\nAlthough ancient Greek philosophers were unfamiliar with biblical revelation, they attempted to make attempts to explain man’s universe on the basis of a higher being (or higher beings). Various systems of thoughts were presented and evolved into “reasonable” explanations of who this higher being (or these higher beings) could be:\n\nPolytheism – The belief in many gods.\nHylozoism – The belief that the life principle found in all creation is God Himself.\nMaterialism – The belief that matter is self-functioning according to natural law and no god is necessary to its functioning (i.e. a theory supporting modern evolutionism!).\nPantheism – The belief that God is impersonal and identical with nature itself. God is immanent (i.e. “close and involved with all of creation”) but not transcendent (i.e. “separate from and far more advanced than all of creation”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll of man’s various beliefs and concepts about the existence and explanation of God (or gods) can be traced back to one of these four developed Greek theories."

    "text": "Four Main Arguments for the Existence of God Based Solely on the Facts of Creation\n\nThe Ontological Argument – Of or relating to the argument for the existence of God holding that man’s universal “belief in God” and the overwhelming existence of the “concept of God” proves the existence of God. It is widely accepted that the first ontological argument was proposed by Anselm of Canterbury. Anselm’s argument goes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnselm’s Ontological Argument\n\n\n\n\nGod is the greatest possible being we can conceive whose being could exist in the mind.\nIf the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality.\nIf it only exists in the mind, a greater being is possible – one which exists in the mind and in reality.\n\n\n\nThe Cosmological Argument – Every effect must have its sufficient cause and, therefore, the universe, which is an effect, must have a Creator as its cause. Logic based on these premises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosmological Argument\n\n\n\n\nWhatever begins to exist has a cause.\nThe Universe began to exist.\nTherefore, the Universe had a cause.\nThe cause of the universe (i.e. all things created) can be called God.\n\n\n\nThe Teleological Argument – Everything that has been designed must have a designer. Since creation as a whole reveals itself as being intricately designed and interrelated, creation must have a great designer. This designer can be called God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeleological Argument\n\n\n\n\nIf you found a watch lying on the ground, you would not assume that the watch “accidentally” came into existence by colliding metal, glass, and wires.\nRather, you would naturally assume there must be a “watchmaker” who designed and made the watch.\nIn the same way, since the universe has shown itself to be vastly more complicated, more intricately designed, and more dependable than a watch, there must be a “creation maker” who made the universe of infinite power and wisdom.\nThis “creation maker” can be called God.\n\n\n\n\nPsalm 19:1-4 1(To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.) The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 2Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 3There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 4Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,\n\nThe Anthropological Argument – The nature and existence of man is unexplainable apart from being created by someone who has a nature similar to but greater than man’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthropological Argument\n\n\n\n\n“Mankind” is different from all other objects in creation\nMan has intellect (capacity to think and reason), sensibility (capacity to feel and have emotions), and will (capacity to make moral choices based on what man thinks or feels).\nSuch extraordinary abilities not found elsewhere in nature could not have come into existence except through a being who has similar but greater abilities (i.e. “non-thinking” objects can not create “thinking” objects; “non-emotional” objects can not produce “emotional” objects etc.)\nThis being who created the unique creature “man” can be called God.\nTherefore, God must be ultra-intelligent, with emotions, and the ability to make His own decisions!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these arguments have considerable validity to prove that it is very reasonable for man to believe in the “existence of God”, they are not sufficient to bring man into a proper understanding or relationship with God.\nIt is in the “BIBLE” that the complete revelation of God is given, confirming all the facts found in nature but adding to natural revelation many truths which natural revelation COULD NOT HAVE DISCLOSED!\n\nJames 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.\n\n\n1 Corinthians 2:10-14 10But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 11For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 12Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 14But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\n\n\nRomans 10:13-17 13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 14How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! 16But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 17So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."

    "text": "Four Main Arguments for the Existence of God Based Solely on the Facts of Creation\n\nI. There is only “ONE” God who exists as a Divine “Trinity”\n\nThe Old Testament emphasizes the “unity” (1.e. “oneness’’) of God.\n\nExodus 20:2-3 “I am (i.e. singular pronoun and singular being verb) the LORD thy God (singular noun), which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me (singular pronoun).”\n\n\nDeuteronomy 6:4 “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:”\n\n\nIsaiah 44:6 “Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.”\n\nThe New Testament emphasizes the “unity” (i.e. “oneness”) of God.\n\nJohn 10:30 “I and my Father are one.” (i.e. Jesus did not say that He and His Father are TWO Gods!)\n\n\nJohn 14:9 “Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?”\n\n\nJohn 17:11 “.And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.”\n\n\nJohn 17:22-23 “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.”\n\n\nColossians 1:19 “For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;”\n\nThe Old Testament and New Testament indicates that God exists as a Trinity,\n\nPlural personal pronouns are used for God in the Old Testament\n\nGenesis 1:26 “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:”\n\n\nGenesis 3:22 “And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil:’”\n\n\nGenesis 11:6-7 6And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 7Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.\n\n\nDistinctions within the nature of God in terms of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are revealed in the Old Testament.\n\nIsaiah 7:14 “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Immanuel” -– is a symbolic and prophetic name of the Messiah, the Christ, prophesying that He would be born of a virgin and would be ‘God with us’.\nNew Testament Verses Confirming Jesus is “the Son” referred here:\n\nActs 4:25-26 25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? (See Ps.2:1 !) 26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. (Compare this to Ps.2:2!).\n\n\nActs 13: 33 “God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.”\n\n\n\n\nIsaiah 9:6 “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”\n\n\nPsalm 2:7-8 “I will declare the decree: the LORD (i.e. God, the Father) hath said unto me, Thou art my Son (i.e. God, the Son); this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”\n\n\nPsalm 104:30 “Thou (i.e. God, the Father) sendest forth thy spirit (i.e. God, the Spirit), they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.”\n\n\nDistinctions within the nature of God in terms of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are revealed in the New Testament.\n\nJohn 1:1-3 1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same (i.e, the being called the Word) was in the beginning with God. 2All things were made by him (i.e. personal pronoun referring to the Word) ; and without him (i.e, personal pronoun referring to the Word)  was not any thing made that was made (i.e. the act of ‘making’ can only be done by a person).\n\n\nJohn 1:14 “And the Word (i.e. God, the Son) was made flesh, and dwelt among us (i.e. Immanuel of Isa. 7:14), and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten (cf. Ps.2:7) of the Father (i.e. God, the Father), full of grace and truth.”\n\n\nMatthew 3:16-17 16And Jesus (i.e. God, the Son), when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God (i.e. God, the Spirit) descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 17And lo a voice from heaven (i.e. God, the Father), saying, This is my beloved Son (i.e. God, the Son), in whom I (i.e. God, the Father) am well pleased.\n\n\nJohn 14:16-17 “And I (i.e. God, the Son) will pray the Father (i.e. God, the Father), and he shall give you another Comforter (i.e. God, the Spirit), that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit (i.e. God, the Spirit) of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him (i.e. personal pronoun “him” not “it” indicating a person not just power) not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.”\n\n\nJohn 14:26 But the Comforter (i.e. God, the Spirit), which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father (i.e. God, the Father) will send in my name, he shall teach (i.e. act of a “person” not an object/mere power) you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I (i.e. God, the Son) have said unto you.\n\n\n1 Corinthians 6:19 “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost (i.e. God, the Spirit) which is in you, which ye have of God (i.e. God, the Father), and ye are not your own?”\n\n\nJohn 14:20 “At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nJesus is saying that the Father, the Holy Spirit and He (i.e. Jesus) are “one, in the same God” thatwill be dwelling inside every believer.\n\n\n\nActs 5:3-4 3But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost (i.e. God, the Spirit), and to keep back part of the price of the land? 4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God (i.e. God, the Spirit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPeter reveals that the Holy Spirit that Ananias lied to was God, Himself!\n\n\n\nActs 13:2 “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost (i.e. God, the Spirit) said (i.e. act of a person, not an “it”), Separate me (i.e. commanding tone of being their Lord) Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called (i.e. sending messengers (e.g. prophets, apostles, etc) is an act of God alone. See Eph.4:11 & Luke 11:49) them.”\n\n\nMatthew 28:18-20 18And Jesus (i.e. God, the Son) came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (i.e. a daring statement if Jesus is just mere human). 19Go ye (i.e. commanding tone as Lord) therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name (i.e. singular name) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (i.e. plural persons): 20Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\n\nThe many indications in both the Old and New Testaments that God exists as one God that is a “triune being” have made the doctrine of the Trinity a central FACT of all orthodox creeds from the early church until modern times:\n\nAny departure from the teaching that the Bible reveals God as existing as “One God in Three Persons” is considered a departure from scriptural truth (i.e. heretical teaching!).\nAlthough the word “Trinity” does not occur in the Bible, the facts of scriptural revelation permit no other explanation.\n\nWhile the doctrine of the Trinity is a central fact of Christian faith, it is also beyond human comprehension and has no parallel in human experience: :\n\nIt is best defined as holding that, while God is one God, He exists in three persons.\nThese persons are equal, have the same attributes, and are equally worthy of adoration, worship, and faith.\nThey are NOT three separate gods, like three separate human beings as Peter, James, and John.\nThe persons of the Trinity, while having equal attributes, differ in certain properties:\n\nThe First Person of the Trinity is called God, the Father.\nThe Second Person of the Trinity is called God, the Son and is sent forth by the Father.\nThe Third Person of the Trinity is called God, the Holy Spirit and is sent forth by the Son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is called the doctrine of procession, and the order is NEVER reversed; that is, the Son never sends forth the Father and the Spirit never sends the Son!\n\n\n\nSince the uniqueness of the Godhead has no illustration or parallel in human experience, the doctrine of the “Trinity” should be accepted by “faith” on the basis of scriptural revelation even if it is beyond human comprehension and definition.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. The Names of God\n\nIn the Old Testament, three principal names are ascribed to God:\n\n“Jehovah” (Latin) or “Yahweh” (Hebrew) — the name of God applied only to the true God.\n\nThe name first appears in connection with Creation\n\nGenesis 2:4 “These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God (i.e. “Jehovah” or “Yahweh” ) made the earth and the heavens,”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhenever you see the word “Lord” capitalized as “LORD”, that means the English word “LORD” is representing the Hebrew word for the true (and only God): “YAHWEH ’.\n\n\nThe meaning of the name “Jehovah” or “Yahweh” is defined as “the self-existent, eternal God”\n\nExodus 3:13-14 13And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“I AM” was written as “YHWH” by Moses (because they do not have “vowels”). “Yahweh” is written in a way for us to be able to say the name of the “self- existent” God.\n\n\n\nThe most common name for God in the Old Testament is “Elohim”:\n\nGenesis 1:1 “In the beginning God (i.e. “Elohim”) created the heaven and the earth.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n“Elohim” is used in the Old Testament 2,570 times, and every usage is plural- “gods”.\nAs shown by this plurality, the God Family clearly consists of more than one Person or Personality.\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of the name has been debated, but seems to include the idea of being the “strong one” and being one to be feared or reverenced.\nBecause it is in a plural form, it seems to include all the Trinity.\n\nGenesis 1:26 “And God (i.e. “Elohim” - plural) said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”\n\n\nThe third name for God in the Old Testament is “Adonai”:\n\nCommonly means “master” or “lord” and is used not only of God as our Master, but also of men who are masters over their servants.\nWhen God is written as “LORD” in the Bible, this means the name “Yahweh” is being translated into English; but, when God is written as “Lord” in the Bible, this means “Adonai” is being translated into English.\n“Adonai” is frequently joined to “Elohim” in the Bible and when so used it emphasizes the fact that God is our Master or Lord:\n\nGenesis 15:2 “And Abram said, Lord GOD (i.e. Adonai Elohim), what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?”\n\n\n\nTo the combinations of the three primary names of God are many other compounds found in the Old Testament such as:\n\n“Jehovah-jireh” (meaning “the Lord will provide’)\n\nGenesis 22:14 “And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.”\n\n“Jehovah-rapha” (meaning “the Lord who heals”)\n\nExodus 15:26 “And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. (i.e. “Jehovah-rapha”’). ”\n\n“Jehovah-nissi” (meaning “the Lord my banner”)\n\nExodus 17:15-16 15And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: 16For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\n\n“Jehovah-shalom” (meaning “the Lord of our peace’):\n\nJudges 6:23-24 23And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. 24Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n\n“Jehovah-tsidkenu” (meaning “the Lord our righteousness”):\n\nJeremiah 23:5-6 5Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. 6In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (i.e. “Jehovah-tsidkenu”’). ”\n\n“Jehovah-shammah” (meaning “the Lord is present”):\n\nEzekiel 48:35 “It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there. (i.e. “Jehovah-shammah”). ”\n\n\nIn the New Testament, additional titles of God are found:\n\nThe First Person of the Trinity as being distinguished as “the Father”, the Second Person distinguished as “the Son”, and the Third Person distinguished as “the Holy Spirit”. These titles, of course, are also found in the Old Testament but are more common in the New Testament.\nDiscussion of these terms in detail will follow in Doctrines dealing with each of the three persons of the Trinity.\n\n\n\n\nIII. The Attributes of God:\n\nIn the essential being of God, there are certain inherent “attributes” (or “essential qualities”) of God.\nThese attributes are eternally held by the Triune God and are equal for each person of the Godhead.\nIncluded in the attributes is the fact that:\n\nGod is Spirit (i.e. “not material or physical in His eternal existence”)\n\nJohn 4:24 “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”\n\nGod is Life\n\nJohn 5:26 “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;”\n\nGod is Self-Existent\n\nExodus 3:14 “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.”\n\nGod is Infinite\n\nPsalm 145:3 “Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.”\n\nGod is Immutable (or “changeless”)\n\nPsalm 102:25-27 25Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 26They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 27But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.\n\n\nMalachi 3:6 “For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”\n\n\nJames 1:17 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”\n\nGod is Truth\n\nDeuteronomy 32:4 “He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.”\n\n\nPsalm 31:5 “Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.”\n\n\nJohn 14:6 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”\n\nGod is Love\n\n1 John 4:8 “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”\n\nGod is Eternal\n\nPsalm 90:2 “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.”\n\nGod is Holy\n\n1 Peter 1:15-16 15But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 16Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.”\n\n\n1 John 1:5 “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.”\n\nGod is Omnipresent (i.e. “everywhere all at the same time”)\n\nPsalm 139:7-8 7Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.\n\nGod is Omniscient (i.e. “knows everything; is in the process of learning nothing!”’)\n\nPsalm 139:16 “Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.”\n\n\nPsalm 147:4-5 “Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.”\n\n\nIsaiah 42:8-9 8I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 9Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.\n\nGod is Omnipotent (i.e. “all powerful; does whatever He desires”)\n\nIsaiah 43:11-13 11I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour. 12I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God. 13Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?\n\n\nMatthew 19:26 “But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.”\n\n\nVariations of God’s attributes can be seen in the fact that God is “good”, God is “merciful”, and God is “sovereign”.\nAll perfections are ascribed to God to infinity, and His works as well as His being are perfect.\nThe great detail and design of the universe are evidence of His sovereignty, power, and wisdom; His plan of salvation, as revealed in the Scriptures, is evidence of His love, righteousness, and grace.\nNo aspect of creation is too large for Him to be in complete control, and no detail, even to the falling of a sparrow, is too small to be included in His sovereign plan.\n\n\n\nIV. The Sovereignty of God:\n\nThe attributes of God make clear that God is supreme over all. He yields to no other power, authority or glory, and is not subject to any absolute greater than Himself.\nHe represents perfection to an infinite degree in every aspect of His being. He can NEVER be surprised, defeated, or uncertain.\nHowever, without sacrificing His authority or jeopardizing the final realization of His perfect will, it has pleased God to give men a “measure” of freedom of choice, and for the exercise of this choice, God holds man responsible.\nBecause man in his depraved state is blind and insensitive to the work of God, it is clear from Scripture that men do not turn to God apart from the moving of His Spirit in their hearts: John 6:44 “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.\n\nJohn 16:7-11 7Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 8One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him, 9There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 10And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 11And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.n the human side, however, man is held responsible for unbelief and is commanded to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved..\n\n\nActs 16:31 “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”\n\nIt is also true that in the affairs of men, especially of Christians, God works to accomplish His will:\n\nPhilippians 2:13 “. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\n\nYet, God does not force men to yield themselves to Him but rather beseeches them to do so:\n\nRomans 12:1 “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”\n\nThe fact that God has given to men certain freedom does not introduce an element of uncertainty into the universe, as God anticipates in advance and knows to infinity all that man will do in response to the divine and human influences which come into his life.\nHis sovereignty therefore infinitely extends to every act even if it be to the temporary permission of evil that ultimately God might be glorified.\n\n\n\nV. The Degree of God:\n\nThe sovereign purpose of God is defined theologically as the “decree of God”, referring to the comprehensive plan that includes all events of every classification which will occur.The decree of God includes those events which God does Himself and also includes all that God accomplishes through natural law, over which He is completely sovereign.\nMore difficult to comprehend is the fact that His sovereign decree also extends to all the acts of men, which are included in His eternal plan. While incomprehensible to us, it is evident that the all-wise God, having complete knowledge of what man would do in his freedom, in electing to give man freedom of choice does not introduce any element of uncertainty.\n\nThis means, the divine plan, accordingly, included permitting man to sin as Adam and Eve did with all the resultant acts of sin.\nIt included the divine remedy of Christ dying on the cross and all the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing men to repentance and faith in spite of their sin.\n\nAlthough the working of God in human hearts is inscrutable (i.e. “cannot be learned or understood”), the Bible is plain that on the one hand what man does has been included in God’s eternal decree and on the other hand man operates with freedom of choice and is held responsible for his choices."
