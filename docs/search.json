That is very absurd.” \n\nJesus died, but God cannot die.\n\n“If Jesus is God, then why did he die?\n\nJesus said “The Father is greater than I”.\n\n“If Jesus is God, then why did he say that Father is greater than him in John 14:28? Doesn’t this clearly show that Jesus is different from God?”\n\n\nJohn 14:28 – Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.\n\nJesus is only human mediator and not God.\n\n“Can’t you see that I Timothy 2:5 clearly says ‘There is only one God’ and that Jesus is just a man?”\n\n\nI Timothy 2:5 – For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\n\nJesus said in the Bible that he is not God.\n\n“Can’t you see in the Mark 10:18, that Jesus reprimands a person calling him good and saying that there is only one good and that is God? Clearly, he is saying that he does not want to be called good because he is not God.”\n\n\nMark 10:18 – And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God."
