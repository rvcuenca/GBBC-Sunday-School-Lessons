## Introduction

In the last lesson, we have listed down the so-called "laws" that serve as tools for our analysis in resolving the common issues regarding the deity of Christ. We now present the basic assumption or core beliefs that we accept by faith based on the Scriptures upon which we anchor our succeeding logical responses on addressing the said issues. The first of which pertains to God's very existence based on both the facts about Creation and facts based on Scriptures.

## The Belief in the Existence of God

1.  The belief that a divine being exists who is greater than man has been common to all cultures \| and civilizations.

2.  Man seems intuitively, by his very religious nature, to reach out to some sort of higher being.

3.  This has been due in part to the fact that man reasons there must be an explanation for our world and for human existence, and that a being greater than man would serve to explain this.

4.  Ordinarily, men do not ask for proofs of their own existence nor the existence of material things which they recognize by their senses.

5.  Although God is unseen as to His person, His existence is so evident that men generally require no proofs for the fact that there is a God.

6.  The evidence for the existence of God in creation is so clear that rejection of it is the ground of condemnation of the heathen world regardless of whether or not they have heard the Gospel message. The Bible reveals that doubt of God’s existence is primarily due to man’s own perversity and blindness and to satanic influence.

    > Romans 1:18-20 “ ^18^For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; ^19^Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. ^20^For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:”

7.  Although ancient Greek philosophers were unfamiliar with biblical revelation, they attempted to make attempts to explain man’s universe on the basis of a higher being (or higher beings). Various systems of thoughts were presented and evolved into “reasonable” explanations of who this higher being (or these higher beings) could be:

    (a) **Polytheism** – The belief in many gods.

    (b) **Hylozoism** – The belief that the life principle found in all creation is God Himself.

    (c) **Materialism** – The belief that matter is self-functioning according to natural law and no god is necessary to its functioning (i.e. a theory supporting modern evolutionism!).

    (d) **Pantheism** – The belief that God is impersonal and identical with nature itself. God is immanent (i.e. “close and involved with all of creation”) but not transcendent (i.e. “separate from and far more advanced than all of creation”).

    ::: callout-note
    All of man’s various beliefs and concepts about the existence and explanation of God (or gods) can be traced back to one of these four developed Greek theories.

## Four Main Arguments for the Existence of God Based Solely on the Facts of Creation

1.  **The Ontological Argument** – Of or relating to the argument for the existence of God holding that man’s universal “belief in God” and the overwhelming existence of the “concept of God” proves the existence of God. It is widely accepted that the first ontological argument was proposed by Anselm of Canterbury. Anselm's argument goes as follows:

    ::: callout-tip
    ## Anselm's Ontological Argument

    1.  God is the greatest possible being we can conceive whose being could exist in the mind.
    2.  If the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality.
    3.  If it only exists in the mind, a greater being is possible – one which exists in the mind and in reality.
    :::

2.  **The Cosmological Argument** – Every effect must have its sufficient cause and, therefore, the universe, which is an effect, must have a Creator as its cause. Logic based on these premises:

    ::: callout-tip
    ## Cosmological Argument

    1.  Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
    2.  The Universe began to exist.
    3.  Therefore, the Universe had a cause.
    4.  The cause of the universe (i.e. all things created) can be called God.
    :::

3.  **The Teleological Argument** – Everything that has been designed must have a designer. Since creation as a whole reveals itself as being intricately designed and interrelated, creation must have a great designer. This designer can be called God.

    ::: callout-tip
    ## Teleological Argument

    1.  If you found a watch lying on the ground, you would not assume that the watch “accidentally” came into existence by colliding metal, glass, and wires.
    2.  Rather, you would naturally assume there must be a “watchmaker” who designed and made the watch.
    3.  In the same way, since the universe has shown itself to be vastly more complicated, more intricately designed, and more dependable than a watch, there must be a “creation maker” who made the universe of infinite power and wisdom.
    4.  This “creation maker” can be called God.
    :::

    > Psalm 19:1-4 ^1^(To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.) The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. ^2^Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. ^3^There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. ^4^Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

4.  **The Anthropological Argument** – The nature and existence of man is unexplainable apart from being created by someone who has a nature similar to but greater than man’s.

    ::: callout-tip
    ## Anthropological Argument

    1.  “Mankind” is different from all other objects in creation
    2.  Man has intellect (capacity to think and reason), sensibility (capacity to feel and have emotions), and will (capacity to make moral choices based on what man thinks or feels).
    3.  Such extraordinary abilities not found elsewhere in nature could not have come into existence except through a being who has similar but greater abilities (i.e. “non-thinking” objects can not create “thinking” objects; “non-emotional” objects can not produce “emotional” objects etc.)
    4.  This being who created the unique creature “man” can be called God.
    5.  Therefore, God must be ultra-intelligent, with emotions, and the ability to make His own decisions!
    :::

::: callout-important
-   Although these arguments have considerable validity to prove that it is very reasonable for man to believe in the “existence of God”, they are not sufficient to bring man into a proper understanding or relationship with God.

-   [*It is in the “**BIBLE**” that the complete revelation of God is given*]{.underline}, confirming all the facts found in nature but adding to natural revelation many truths which natural revelation COULD NOT HAVE DISCLOSED!

    > James 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.

    > 1 Corinthians 2:10-14 ^10^But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. ^11^For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. ^12^Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. ^14^But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know *them*, because they are spiritually discerned.

    > Romans 10:13-17 ^13^For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ^14^How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? ^15^And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! ^16^But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? ^17^[So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.]{.underline}

## Four Main Arguments for the Existence of God Based Solely on the Facts of Creation

### I. There is only “ONE” God who exists as a Divine “Trinity”

A.  The Old Testament emphasizes the “unity” (1.e. “oneness’’) of God.

    > Exodus 20:2-3 “I **am** (i.e. *singular pronoun and singular being verb*) the LORD thy **God** (*singular noun*), which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before **me** *(singular pronoun*).”

    > Deuteronomy 6:4 “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is **one LORD**:”

    > Isaiah 44:6 “Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and **beside me there is no God**.”

B.  The New Testament emphasizes the “unity” (i.e. “oneness”) of God.

    > John 10:30 “I and my Father **are one**.” (i.e. Jesus did not say that He and His Father are TWO Gods!)

    > John 14:9 “Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? **he that hath seen me hath seen the Father**; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?”

    > John 17:11 “.And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be **one, as we are**.”

    > John 17:22-23 “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, **even as we are one**: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be **made perfect in one**; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.”

    > Colossians 1:19 “For it pleased the Father that **in him should all fulness dwell**;”

C.  The Old Testament and New Testament indicates that God exists as a Trinity,

    1.  Plural personal pronouns are used for God in the Old Testament

        > Genesis 1:26 “And God said, Let **us** make man in **our** image, after **our** likeness:"

        > Genesis 3:22 “And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of **us**, to know good and evil:’”

        > Genesis 11:6-7 ^6^And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. ^7^Go to, **let us go down**, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

        a.  Distinctions within the nature of God in terms of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are revealed in the Old Testament.

            > Isaiah 7:14 “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.”

            ::: callout-note
            “Immanuel” -– is a symbolic and prophetic name of the Messiah, the Christ, prophesying that He would be born of a virgin and would be ‘God with us'.

            **New Testament Verses Confirming Jesus is "the Son" referred here:**

            > Acts 4:25-26 ^25^ Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? (See **Ps.2:1 !**) ^26^ The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together **against the Lord**, and **against his Christ**. (Compare this to **Ps.2:2!**).

            > Acts 13: 33 "God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that **he hath raised up Jesus again**; as it is also written in the second psalm, **Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee**."
            :::

            > Isaiah 9:6 “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, **The mighty God**, **The everlasting Father**, The Prince of Peace.”

            > Psalm 2:7-8 “I will declare the decree: the LORD (*i.e. God, the Father)* hath said unto me, Thou art my Son (*i.e. God, the Son)*; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”

            > Psalm 104:30 “Thou (*i.e. God, the Father*) sendest forth **thy spirit** (*i.e. God, the Spirit*), they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.”

    2.  Distinctions within the nature of God in terms of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are revealed in the New Testament.

        > John 1:1-3 ^1^In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same (i.e, the being called **the Word**) was in the beginning with God. ^2^All things were made by **him** (*i.e.* *personal pronoun referring to* **the Word**) ; and without **him** (*i.e, personal pronoun referring to* **the Word**)  was not any thing made that was made (*i.e. the act of 'making' can only be done by a person*).

        > John 1:14 “And **the Word** (*i.e. **God, the Son***) was made flesh, and dwelt among us (*i.e. **Immanuel** of **Isa. 7:14***), and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten (*cf. **Ps.2:7***) of the Father (*i.e. **God, the Father***), full of grace and truth.”

        > Matthew 3:16-17 ^16^And Jesus (i.e. **God, the Son**), when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God (i.e. **God, the Spirit**) descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: ^17^And lo a voice from heaven (i.e. **God, the Father**), saying, This is my beloved Son (i.e. **God, the Son**), in whom I (i.e. **God, the Father**) am well pleased.

        > John 14:16-17 “And I (i.e. **God, the Son**) will pray the Father (i.e. **God, the Father**), and he shall give you another Comforter (i.e. **God, the Spirit**), that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit (i.e. **God, the Spirit**) of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth **him** *(i.e. personal pronoun “him” not “it” indicating a person not just power*) not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.”

        > John 14:26 But the Comforter (i.e. **God, the Spirit**), which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father (i.e. **God, the Father**) will send in my name, he shall teach (i.e. **act of a “person” not an object/mere power**) you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I (i.e. **God, the Son**) have said unto you.

        > 1 Corinthians 6:19 “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost (i.e. **God, the Spirit**) which is in you, which ye have of God (i.e. **God, the Father**), and ye are not your own?”

        > John 14:20 “At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.”

        ::: callout-note
        Jesus is saying that the Father, the Holy Spirit and He (i.e. Jesus) are “one, in the same God” thatwill be dwelling inside every believer.
        :::

        > Acts 5:3-4 ^3^But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost (i.e. **God, the Spirit**), and to keep back part of the price of the land? ^4^ Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God (i.e. **God, the Spirit**).

        ::: callout-note
        Peter reveals that the Holy Spirit that Ananias lied to was God, Himself!
        :::

        > Acts 13:2 “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost (i.e. **God, the Spirit**) said (i.e. **act of a person, not an “it”**), **Separate me** (i.e. **commanding tone of being their Lord**) Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called (i.e. **sending messengers (e.g. prophets, apostles, etc) is an act of God alone. See Eph.4:11 & Luke 11:49**) them.”

        > Matthew 28:18-20 ^18^And Jesus (i.e. **God, the Son**) came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (i.e. **a daring statement if Jesus is just mere human**). ^19^Go ye (i.e. **commanding tone as Lord**) therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name (i.e. **singular name**) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (i.e. **plural persons**): ^20^Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

    3.  The many indications in both the Old and New Testaments that God exists as one God that is a “triune being” have made the doctrine of the Trinity a central FACT of all orthodox creeds from the early church until modern times:

        i.  Any departure from the teaching that the Bible reveals God as existing as “One God in Three Persons” is considered a departure from scriptural truth (i.e. heretical teaching!).

        ii. Although the word “Trinity” does not occur in the Bible, the facts of scriptural revelation permit no other explanation.

    4.  While the doctrine of the Trinity is a central fact of Christian faith, it is also beyond human comprehension and has no parallel in human experience: :

        a.  It is best defined as holding that, while God is one God, He exists in three persons.

        b.  These persons are equal, have the same attributes, and are equally worthy of adoration, worship, and faith.

        c.  They are NOT three separate gods, like three separate human beings as Peter, James, and John.

        d.  The persons of the Trinity, while having equal attributes, differ in certain properties:

            i.  The First Person of the Trinity is called God, the Father.

            ii. The Second Person of the Trinity is called God, the Son and is sent forth by the Father.

            iii. The Third Person of the Trinity is called God, the Holy Spirit and is sent forth by the Son.

                 ::: callout-note
                 This is called the doctrine of procession, and the order is NEVER reversed; that is, the Son never sends forth the Father and the Spirit never sends the Son!
                 :::

        e.  Since the uniqueness of the Godhead has no illustration or parallel in human experience, the doctrine of the “Trinity” should be accepted by “faith” on the basis of scriptural revelation even if it is beyond human comprehension and definition.

### II. The Names of God

A.  In the Old Testament, three principal names are ascribed to God:

    1)  “Jehovah” (Latin) or “Yahweh” (Hebrew) — the name of God applied only to the true God.

        a)  The name first appears in connection with Creation

            > Genesis 2:4 “These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God (**i.e. “Jehovah” or “Yahweh”** ) made the earth and the heavens,”

            ::: callout-note
            Whenever you see the word “Lord” capitalized as “LORD”, that means the English word “LORD” is representing the Hebrew word for the true (and only God): “YAHWEH ’.
            :::

        b)  The meaning of the name “Jehovah” or “Yahweh” is defined as “the self-existent, eternal God”

            > Exodus 3:13-14 ^13^And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, [What is his name? what shall I say unto them?]{.underline} ^14^ And God said unto Moses, **I AM THAT I AM**: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, **I AM** hath sent me unto you.

            ::: callout-note
            “I AM” was written as “YHWH” by Moses (because they do not have “vowels”). “Yahweh” is written in a way for us to be able to say the name of the “self- existent” God.
            :::

    2)  The most common name for God in the Old Testament is “Elohim”:

        > Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning God (**i.e. “Elohim”**) created the heaven and the earth.”

        ::: callout-note
        -   **“Elohim”** is used in the Old Testament 2,570 times, and every usage is plural- “gods”.
        -   As shown by this plurality, the God Family clearly consists of more than one Person or Personality.
        :::

        a)  The meaning of the name has been debated, but seems to include the idea of being the “strong one” and being one to be feared or reverenced.

        b)  Because it is in a plural form, it seems to include all the Trinity.

            > Genesis 1:26 “And God (**i.e. “Elohim” - plural**) said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."

    3)  The third name for God in the Old Testament is “Adonai”:

        a)  Commonly means “master” or “lord” and is used not only of God as our Master, but also of men who are masters over their servants.

        b)  When God is written as “LORD” in the Bible, this means the name “Yahweh” is being translated into English; but, when God is written as “Lord” in the Bible, this means “Adonai” is being translated into English.

        c)  “Adonai” is frequently joined to “Elohim” in the Bible and when so used it emphasizes the fact that God is our Master or Lord:

            > Genesis 15:2 “And Abram said, Lord GOD (**i.e. Adonai Elohim**), what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?”

B.  To the combinations of the three primary names of God are many other compounds found in the Old Testament such as:

    1)  “Jehovah-jireh” (meaning “the Lord will provide’)

        > Genesis 22:14 “And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen."

    2)  “Jehovah-rapha” (meaning “the Lord who heals”)

        > Exodus 15:26 “And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I *am* the LORD that healeth thee. (i.e. “Jehovah-rapha”’). ”

    3)  “Jehovah-nissi” (meaning “the Lord my banner”)

        > Exodus 17:15-16 ^15^And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: ^16^For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn *that* the LORD *will have* war with Amalek from generation to generation.

    4)  “Jehovah-shalom” (meaning “the Lord of our peace’):

        > Judges 6:23-24 ^23^And the LORD said unto him, Peace *be* unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. ^24^Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it *is* yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

    5)  “Jehovah-tsidkenu” (meaning “the Lord our righteousness”):

        > Jeremiah 23:5-6 ^5^Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. ^6^In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this *is* his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (i.e. “Jehovah-tsidkenu”’). ”

    6)  “Jehovah-shammah” (meaning “the Lord is present”):

        > Ezekiel 48:35 “*It was* round about eighteen thousand *measures*: and the name of the city from *that* day *shall be*, The LORD *is* there. (i.e. “Jehovah-shammah”). ”

C.  In the New Testament, additional titles of God are found:

    1)  The First Person of the Trinity as being distinguished as “the Father”, the Second Person distinguished as “the Son”, and the Third Person distinguished as “the Holy Spirit”. These titles, of course, are also found in the Old Testament but are more common in the New Testament.

    2)  Discussion of these terms in detail will follow in Doctrines dealing with each of the three persons of the Trinity.

### III. The Attributes of God:

1.  In the essential being of God, there are certain inherent “attributes” (or “essential qualities”) of God.

2.  These attributes are eternally held by the Triune God and are equal for each person of the Godhead.

3.  Included in the attributes is the fact that:

    a)  God is Spirit (i.e. “not material or physical in His eternal existence”)

        > John 4:24 “God *is* a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship *him* in spirit and in truth.”

    b)  God is Life

        > John 5:26 “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;"

    c)  God is Self-Existent

        > Exodus 3:14 “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.”

    d)  God is Infinite

        > Psalm 145:3 “Great *is* the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness *is* unsearchable.”

    e)  God is Immutable (or “changeless”)

        > Psalm 102:25-27 ^25^Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens *are* the work of thy hands. ^26^They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: ^27^But thou *art* the same, and thy years shall have no end.

        > Malachi 3:6 “For I *am* the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”

        > James 1:17 “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."

    f)  God is Truth

        > Deuteronomy 32:4 “*He is* the Rock, his work *is* perfect: for all his ways *are* judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right *is* he.”

        > Psalm 31:5 “Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.”

        > John 14:6 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."

    g)  God is Love

        > 1 John 4:8 “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”

    h)  God is Eternal

        > Psalm 90:2 “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou *art* God.”

    i)  God is Holy

        > 1 Peter 1:15-16 ^15^But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; ^16^Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.”

        > 1 John 1:5 “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.”

    j)  God is Omnipresent (i.e. “everywhere all at the same time”)

        > Psalm 139:7-8 ^7^Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? ^8^If I ascend up into heaven, thou *art* there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou *art there*.

    k)  God is Omniscient (i.e. “knows everything; is in the process of learning nothing!”’)

        > Psalm 139:16 “Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all *my members* were written, *which* in continuance were fashioned, when *as yet there was* none of them.”

        > Psalm 147:4-5 "Great *is* our Lord, and of great power: his understanding *is* infinite."

        > Isaiah 42:8-9 ^8^I *am* the LORD: that *is* my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. ^9^Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

    l)  God is Omnipotent (i.e. “all powerful; does whatever He desires”)

        > Isaiah 43:11-13 ^11^I, *even* I, *am* the LORD; and beside me *there is* no saviour. ^12^I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when *there was* no strange *god* among you: therefore ye *are* my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I *am* God. ^13^Yea, before the day *was* I *am* he; and *there is* none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

        > Matthew 19:26 “But Jesus beheld *them*, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.”

4.  Variations of God’s attributes can be seen in the fact that God is “good”, God is “merciful”, and God is “sovereign”.

5.  All perfections are ascribed to God to infinity, and His works as well as His being are perfect.

6.  The great detail and design of the universe are evidence of His sovereignty, power, and wisdom; His plan of salvation, as revealed in the Scriptures, is evidence of His love, righteousness, and grace.

7.  No aspect of creation is too large for Him to be in complete control, and no detail, even to the falling of a sparrow, is too small to be included in His sovereign plan.

### IV. The Sovereignty of God:

1.  The attributes of God make clear that God is supreme over all. He yields to no other power, authority or glory, and is not subject to any absolute greater than Himself.

2.  He represents perfection to an infinite degree in every aspect of His being. He can NEVER be surprised, defeated, or uncertain.

3.  However, without sacrificing His authority or jeopardizing the final realization of His perfect will, it has pleased God to give men a “measure” of freedom of choice, and for the exercise of this choice, God holds man responsible.

4.  Because man in his depraved state is blind and insensitive to the work of God, it is clear from Scripture that men do not turn to God apart from the moving of His Spirit in their hearts: John 6:44 “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.

    > John 16:7-11 ^7^Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. ^8^One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, ^9^There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? ^10^And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. ^11^And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.n the human side, however, man is held responsible for unbelief and is commanded to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved..

    > Acts 16:31 “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”

5.  It is also true that in the affairs of men, especially of Christians, God works to accomplish His will:

    > Philippians 2:13 “. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of *his* good pleasure.

6.  Yet, God does not force men to yield themselves to Him but rather beseeches them to do so:

    > Romans 12:1 “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, *which is* your reasonable service.”

7.  The fact that God has given to men certain freedom does not introduce an element of uncertainty into the universe, as God anticipates in advance and knows to infinity all that man will do in response to the divine and human influences which come into his life.

8.  His sovereignty therefore infinitely extends to every act even if it be to the temporary permission of evil that ultimately God might be glorified.

### V. The Degree of God:

1.  The sovereign purpose of God is defined theologically as the “decree of God”, referring to the comprehensive plan that includes all events of every classification which will occur.The decree of God includes those events which God does Himself and also includes all that God accomplishes through natural law, over which He is completely sovereign.
2.  More difficult to comprehend is the fact that His sovereign decree also extends to all the acts of men, which are included in His eternal plan. While incomprehensible to us, it is evident that the all-wise God, having complete knowledge of what man would do in his freedom, in electing to give man freedom of choice does not introduce any element of uncertainty.
    a)  This means, the divine plan, accordingly, included permitting man to sin as Adam and Eve did with all the resultant acts of sin.

    b)  It included the divine remedy of Christ dying on the cross and all the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing men to repentance and faith in spite of their sin.
3.  Although the working of God in human hearts is inscrutable (i.e. “cannot be learned or understood”), the Bible is plain that on the one hand what man does has been included in God’s eternal decree and on the other hand man operates with freedom of choice and is held responsible for his choices.
