In the last lesson, we have listed down the common questions raised by critics regarding the deity of Christ. In this lesson, we are going to elaborate some fundamental concepts that will help us provide a clear logical response to each of these issues.

> **1 Peter 3:15** – But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

> **2 Peter 3:15-18** – ^[15](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-15/ "https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-15/")^And account *that* the longsuffering of our Lord *is* salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; ^[16](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-16/ "https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-16/")^ As also in all *his* epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as *they do* also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. ^[17](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-17/ "https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-17/")^Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know *these things* before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. ^[18](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-18/ "https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Peter-3-18/")^But grow in grace, and *in* the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

## Introduction

In 2 Peter 3:15,16, Peter acknowledged the writings of apostle Paul:

1.  as "scripture",
2.  reaffirms the sureness of Jesus' second coming,
3.  contains portions that are "hard to be understood"
4.  had been twisted by false teachers.

The word "*wrest*" in 2 Peter 3:16 stands for the Greek word *"strebloo*" (v. stre-bla-oh) which means *to twist*, *turn awry*, or metaphorically, *to pervert, of one who tortures language in a false sense*[^1]. In other words, even as early as the time of Peter and Paul, there are already false teachers who pervert their written epistles by taking advantage of the possible difficulty understanding their level of writing. That's why in the next verse, v. 17, Peter warns the believers in his time to "*beware lest \[they\] also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from \[their\] own stedfastness.*"

[^1]: See Strong's G4761 <https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4761/kjv/tr/0-1/>.

Peter closes his second epistle by admonishing the believers he addressed to "*grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.*" He points out that the ultimate solution to "fight against" false teachings is to grow both in the grace of our Lord, i.e. to be dependent on His grace for our growth, and in knowledge about our Saviour, i.e. getting to know about who Jesus is and to know Him more on a personal level of relationship. Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:11-14 clearly affirms this point of not being deceived by learning more about the Son of God through agents God has provided for us:

>  ^[11](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-4-11/ "CLICK FOR MORE TRANSLATIONS of Ephesians 4:11- And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;")^And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; ^[12](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-4-12/ "CLICK FOR MORE TRANSLATIONS of Ephesians 4:11- For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:")^For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: ^[13](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-4-13/ "CLICK FOR MORE TRANSLATIONS of Ephesians 4:11- Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:")^Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: ^[14](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ephesians-4-14/ "CLICK FOR MORE TRANSLATIONS of Ephesians 4:11- That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;")^That we *henceforth* be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, *and* cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

Even though Peter and Paul's epistles were written more than 2000 years ago, the same principle even more applies to us today where false teachers have become more bold and rampant in deceiving many. Such deception have been scaled-up to highher level by taking advantage of modern media technology via fast internet connectivity. Thus, we as believers in this post-modern age should be even more proactive in fervently studying God's word to guard not only ourselves but our future generations of believers from the ever "upgrading" deception tactics of the enemy.

## The Tools *Para Dili Mailad* 

**Language traps** refer to words or phrases whose meaning isn’t clear to readers and, worse, can potentially mislead them into thinking you mean something you don’t [@Hurley_2024]. False teachers (and their blinded followers) that utilize *language traps* are either using them intentionally to deceive or even they themselves are not aware that they are using it.

> **2 Timothy 2:13** – But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 

It is important for believers to be equipped with the basics of untangling such traps if ever one encounters them. Learning them not helps you clarify the veiled perversion done by deceivers, it will also help strengthen your reading skills on the word of God.

### The Law of Non-Verbatim

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Even if it is not mentioned word-for-word, it doesn't mean that it is not there.
:::

If a word or phrase describing a concept is not mentioned verbatim (i.e. word-for-word) in a given reference material, it does not follow that the concept itself is not present in the same material.

Examples:

1.  The word "*Trinity"* can never be found word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of *Trinity* is explained in the Bible.
2.  The word "*rapture"* is never mentioned word-for-word in the Bible but the concept of *rapture* is explained in the Bible.

### The Law of Non-Contradiction

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You can never say two opposing claims at the same time.
:::

Two claims of opposite meaning or implication can never be both true at the same time in the same sense. Another way of looking at this is that two opposing descriptions can never be attributed to the same object at the same time.

Examples:

1.  Consider the following two claims:

    i.  Maria ate the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.
    ii. Maria did not eat the black mango on our table yesterday at 1pm.

    If, in the two claims above, we are referring to the same *Maria*, the same *black mango*, the same location (*our table*), and at the same reference point in time (*yesterday at 1pm*), then we have a contradiction here.

2.  Consider the following two claims:

    i.  The top surface of the table is dirty.
    ii. The top surface of the table is clean.

    If we are referring here to the same table, then the two claims are contradictory.

### The Law of Excluded Middle

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
A claim is either true or false but not both.
:::

A claim can never be both true and false at the same time, i.e. it is either true or false but it is never both.

Examples:

1.  Jesus is either God or is not God. However, he can never be both.
2.  Either the Bible has contradictions or it has no contradictions. However, it can never be both cases.

### The Law of Correct Reference Sense

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Are we referring to the same things here?
:::

When you try to resolve another person's claim, be sure that both of you are referring to the same terminologies (in the sense of definition) from the same reference points (object, space, and time).

Example:

Consider the following two claims:

i.  [Person A Claim:]{.underline} *Maria ate the mango.*
ii. [Person B Claim:]{.underline} *Maria did not eat the mango.*

The two claims seems to be contradictory. However, we first need to check the following conditions before proceed with such verdict of contradiction:

a.  Are we referring to the same *Maria*?

    If person A is referring to a different *Maria* compared to that claimed by person B, then it does not make sense in the first place to say that there is a contradiction since the two claims are not comparable.

b.  Are we referring to the same *mango*?

    This is similar to the case of having the same *Maria* being referred to.

c.  Are we referring to the same reference point in time when incident happened?

    Even if we refer to the same *Maria* and the same *mango*,it might still be invalid to say that the two claims are contradictory if we have different reference point in time where the alleged eating happened. It is possible that the two claims are both true, for example, if person A's claim indeed happened yesterday while person B's claim really happened today. In this case, we do not have a contradiction.

### The Law of Logical Absurdity

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Even though it does not make sense to you by experience, it does not follow that it is impossible.
:::

One must differentiate between *personal subjective absurdity* and *logical absurdity*.

-   *Personal subjective absurdity* means that something does not make sense based on one's personal subjective experience but not necessarily logically false in reality.

    For example, if a person living his whole life in an isolated island with no idea of WIFI nor cellular mobile phones, then it would be *absurd* (i.e. does not make sense) to that person if you claim that you can talk to somebody on the other side of the world using a small rectangular object (a.k.a cellphone via the internet). However, even if it does not make sense to him, it does not follow that it is impossible to do so.

-   *Logical absurdity* simply means that it is not logically possible in the sense of the Law of Non-Contradiction.

    For example, one can never have a square shape that is circle at the same time. A logically absurd claim is not only logically contradictory but also does not make sense in the personal subjective level.

### The Law of Accurate Explanation

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Simplicity is not necessarily the correct answer.
:::

Everyone of us, at some point in our lives, at least once desired that some things should be done as simple as possible. Humans, by nature, do not want to complicate things. This also applies in attempting to describe or explain things in our surroundings. No parent has ever attempted to explain scientifically to their 1 year old child what walking is. However, when seeking what is true and is not true, simple explanations just do not fit the role of an arbiter or judge.

Consider the following cases:

-   Person A is a simple farmer in a third-world country in Asia without basic education. He does not need to know about advanced Physics in order to answer the question of what would happened next if a fruit of an apple is cut-off from its branch without catching it. He does not need to know what *gravity* is in order to conclude that the apple would fall to the ground. He simply relies on his daily experience since the day he gained consciousness to interact with the physical reality that objectives when thrown from certain heights would fall downward to the ground.

-   Person B is a high-school student who reads about rockets flying to the outer space. If he wants to learn why rockets no longer fall back to the ground when it reaches a certain height after lunching, he needs to have a more 'above simple' explanation than that of Person A. Person A's *personal subjective experience* no longer can provide a more accurate explanation of the question Person B wants to be answered. Then, Person B learns about Isaac Newton's Law of Gravitation where the concept of *gravity* is now explained: *The farther an object is from the surface of the Earth, the weaker the gravitational pull becomes.* Nobody has seen gravity. However, Newton's 'beyond simple experience' explanation provides a better, more accurate explanation that the force of gravity exists.

### The Law of Evidently Plausible Interpretation

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
The interpretation that is supported by historical and/or scientific evidence, is the more likely correct interpretation.
:::

The Bible, aside from a being the word of God, includes a historical account of past events. Throughout the years, several people both theologians and non-theologians (which include non-believers like cults, atheists, and skeptics) have come up with several interpretations of some passages of the Bible. Aside from our presuppositional stand that the Bible has no contradictions on the bases of our faith that it is the word of God, we also back-up such faith with evidence both historically and scientifically.

If a Biblical passage connects to a scientific or historical claim and has several interpretations, we opt to choose the most interpretation *which is more plausible based on the historical and scientific evidence.*

::: callout-warning
***However,** one should be warned of the dangers of taking scientific theory as truths.* Not all so-called scientific theories are truths. They are called "theory" for a reason since they are "attempted explanations" of some physical reality *under* some simplifying assumptions. Consider the Theory of Evolution which was "celebrated" before but now debunked by the modern scientific community. That is the nature of Science: theories continually evolve to newer ones when new scientific evidence is found. A classic example of this is the theory about gravity which evolved from Newton's Law of Gravitation, to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and to Hawking's Quantum Theory. Each of these has increasing complexity of interpretation regarding the concept of gravity in the face of new evidence.
:::

::: callout-important
Historical evidence, then, ***comes into precedence*** than theories crafted by Science when used as bases for interpreting Bible passages. Historical evidence includes (but not limited to) interpreting by *recounting historical context such as cultural background and customary practices of the people and the place mentioned in the passage*.
:::

### The Law of Consistent Interpretation

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Consistency is always the best policy.
:::

Suppose we have a collection of claims (or statements) that shown to have consistent interpretations (i.e. without the presence of contradictions). If another statement can be interpreted by two but opposing claims, then we prefer to choose the claim that is more consistent with the existing collection.

For example, we have the following COLLECTION of statements:

1.  The Bible has no contradictions.
2.  There are several verses in the Bible that support the claim that salvation is by faith and not by works.
3.  The verses James 2:17, 22 are part of the Bible.
4.  Therefore, the interpretation of James 2:17, 22 should be consistent of the other verses.

Now we have two conflicting claims:

i.  James 2:17, 22 means works + faith =\> salvation (i.e. salvation is by faith AND good works).
ii. Ephesians 2:8, 9 means faith =\> salvation + works. (i.e. faith RESULTS TO salvation and good works).

By the Law of Consistent Interpretation, we opt to choose the second interpretation (ii) since it is consistent with the collection of statements above. If we choose the first statement (i), then we arrive with a contradiction to #2 (salvation is by faith alone) above which consequently contradicts #1 that the Bible has no contradictions.
