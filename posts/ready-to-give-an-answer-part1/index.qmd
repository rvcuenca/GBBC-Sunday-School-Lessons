> **1 Peter 3:15 -** But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

## Introduction

### The Need to be Ready

1.  There are many [skeptics]{.underline} ***who doubt*** the existence of God and/or attack the belief in the God of the Bible.
2.  There are many [critics]{.underline} ***who attack*** the inspiration and inerrancy of the Bible.
3.  There are many [false teachers]{.underline} ***who promote*** false doctrines and ***deny*** the key truths of the Christian faith.
4.  With the strong presence of social media in our everyday lives today, one way or the other *we will encounter posts, reels, or videos of people saying things against what we fundamentally believe.* 

Two common directions that believers who have no strong doctrinal background will do when their faith is shaken by these posts or videos:

1.  **Mohilom.** Ignore and continue to be lax in learning their faith. “I don’t care.”
2.  **Mailad.** Ma-usab ang doktrina.

### **The Need to be Spiritually Wise**

1.  God does not want soldiers in the faith who are “simple-minded”

    > **Proverbs 1:22,23** – ^22^How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? ^23^Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

2.  God does not want soldiers in the faith who are “wise in their own eyes”

    > **Isaiah 5:21 –** Woe unto *them that are* wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

3.  God does not want soldiers in the faith who are “lax in studying His Word”

    > **2 Timothy 2:15** – Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

4.  God does not want soldiers in the faith who engage in “useless debates”

    > **2 Timothy 2:16** – But shun profane *and* vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.

## Common Questions

1.  “How can Jesus be God if he is a man that is limited in nature (e.g. he hungers, thirsts, sleeps, and even died on the cross)?”

2.  “Isn't the Bible full of contradictions?”

3.  “How can salvation be faith alone when it is clear in James 2:17,22 that we need works also?”

4.  “Why are you 100% sure going to heaven when have not met God yet?”

### **Commonly Thrown Objections on the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ**

1.  **Jesus never said “I am God”.**

    > “Show me in the Bible where Jesus said ‘I am God, worship me’.”

2.  **Jesus is not omniscient.**

    > If Jesus is God then why does he not know when he is coming back in Mark 13:32?”

    > **Mark 13:32 –** But of that day and *that* hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

3.  **Jesus prayed to God.**

    > “If Jesus was God, then why would he pray to God in Luke 23:34,46, Matt.27:46, Mark 15:34, John 17, etc? That is very absurd.” 

4.  **Jesus died, but God cannot die.**

    > “If Jesus is God, then why did he die?

5.  **Jesus said “The Father is greater than I”.**

    > “If Jesus is God, then why did he say that Father is greater than him in John 14:28? Doesn’t this clearly show that Jesus is different from God?”

    > **John 14:28 –** Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come *again* unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

6.  **Jesus is only a human mediator and not God.**

    > “Can’t you see that I Timothy 2:5 clearly says ‘There is only one God’ and that Jesus is just a man?”

    > **I Timothy 2:5 –** For *there is* one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

7.  **Jesus said in the Bible that he is not God.**

    > “Can’t you see in the Mark 10:18, that Jesus reprimands a person calling him good and saying that there is only one good and that is God? Clearly, he is saying that he does not want to be called good because he is not God.”

    > **Mark 10:18 –** And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? *there is* none good but one, *that is*, God.
